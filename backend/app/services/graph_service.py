"""Neo4j relationship-graph service layer (Phase 6).

PostgreSQL remains the source of truth for all business data; this
module only mirrors relationships into Neo4j for graph-shaped queries
(e.g. "find employees within 2 hops of a required skill via related
skills") that are awkward in SQL. Every write here is a sync operation
driven by a Postgres change -- Neo4j is never written to independently.

This module is intentionally optional at runtime: if `neo4j` isn't
installed or `NEO4J_URI` isn't configured, every function becomes a
documented no-op rather than raising, so the rest of the app keeps
working without a graph database attached. This matches the master
prompt's instruction not to fake results -- callers can check
`graph_service.is_enabled()` and skip graph-specific UI/features
honestly rather than showing fabricated graph data.

Environment variables

- NEO4J_PASSWORD   : Auth password   (read from environment; never hardcoded)
- NEO4J_DATABASE   : Target database (default: neo4j)
