"""Workforce Intelligence dashboard aggregation (Phase 11).

Every number here comes from a real query against Postgres -- no
hardcoded dashboard statistics, per the master prompt's explicit
instruction. This is also the natural seam for a Redis cache later
(Section 21): wrap get_workforce_overview() with a short TTL cache
once this is called often enough to matter; it's pure, deterministic,
and side-effect-free, so caching it is safe to add without touching
the query logic.
